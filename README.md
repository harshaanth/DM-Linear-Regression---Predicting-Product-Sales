# Summer Products Sales - Regression and Classification Analysis Project

---

## Project Overview

This repository contains two key projects that perform **regression and classification analyses** on the same dataset of summer products, which includes ratings and performance metrics. The two projects involve different types of analysis:

- **Part A: Linear Regression**
- **Part B: Logistic Regression (Classification)**

Both projects aim to identify significant factors influencing product performance, with Part A focusing on predicting continuous outcomes, and Part B focusing on classifying products into categories (popular vs. not popular).

## Part A: Linear Regression

### Description

The **Linear Regression** model was developed to predict a continuous target variable based on multiple predictors. In this case, we used the dataset of summer products to explore the relationships between product ratings, merchant features, and overall performance.

### Files

- **HW_3_Linear_Regression_Project_Report.pdf**: A comprehensive report detailing the methodology, analysis, and results of the linear regression model. This includes data preparation, model fitting, and evaluation metrics such as R-squared, adjusted R-squared, and residual analysis.

- **Linear_Regression_summer-products-with-rating-and-performance_Harshaanth.xlsx**: The Excel file containing the dataset used for linear regression, including the processed data and regression outputs.

## Part B: Logistic Regression (Classification)

### Description

The **Logistic Regression** model was used to perform **classification** to predict the probability that a product falls into one of two categories: popular (1) or not popular (0). The model uses predictor variables such as the presence of a merchant's profile picture, product ratings, and merchant ratings to estimate the likelihood of a product being classified as popular.

### Methodology

1. **Data Preparation**: The dataset was split into training and validation sets to evaluate model performance.
2. **Model Fitting**: Stepwise selection was utilized to identify the most significant predictors for classifying product popularity.
3. **Model Interpretation**: Coefficients were interpreted to understand how each predictor influences the probability of a product being popular.
4. **Model Evaluation**: The model's classification accuracy was assessed using metrics such as the ROC curve, AUC, precision, and recall.

### Files

- **HW_6_Logistic_Regression_Project_Report.pdf**: A detailed report on the logistic regression classification analysis. This includes the logistic regression model, interpretation of coefficients, ROC curve analysis, and precision-recall evaluation.

- **Logistic_Regression_summer-products-with-rating-and-performance_Harshaanth.xlsx**: The Excel file containing the dataset used for logistic regression, along with classification outputs, including predicted probabilities and confusion matrices.

## Summary

This repository provides a comprehensive analysis using both linear regression and logistic regression (classification) to explore factors affecting product performance. The included files offer detailed insights into the methodologies, results, and interpretations, serving as a valuable resource for understanding regression and classification techniques in data analysis.
